Thank you for joining me on a journey to explore the use of Open Data in the civic world. The book is organized into 3 parts - Part 1 provides an overview of what Open Data is, how Open Data is used and who uses Open Data. Part 2 questions the usefulness of Open Data to its producers, how use is measured and what are the challenges faced by producers and consumers of Open Data. Part 3 imagines how information provided by Open Data may be shared, discovered and improved. I have had the great honor to work with many amazing organizations, agencies and governments to implement technology solutions that enabled the unleashing of data and analytics to power decision making and transparency.1 Brown (2020)↩︎ "],["overview.html", "Chapter 2 An Open Data Primer 2.1 What is Open Data? 2.2 How is it used? 2.3 Who uses it?", " Chapter 2 An Open Data Primer 2.1 What is Open Data? \"Open data is information or content made freely available to use and redistribute, subject only to the requirement to attribute it to the source. — Gartner\"2 2.1.1 Types 2.1.1.1 Tabular 2.1.1.2 Spatial 2.1.1.3 Dashboards 2.1.1.4 Stories 2.1.1.5 Visualizations 2.1.1.6 Surveys 2.1.1.7 Reports 2.2 How is it used? 2.2.1 Organizational Goals Public information Transparency Fine tune staffing and location Equity and performance measurement Insights and data mining 2.2.2 News 2.2.3 Civic 2.3 Who uses it?
