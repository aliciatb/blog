<p>I haven’t been an active participant of the RStudio Community (yet), but saw in an e-mail that there was a shiny contest, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/take-part-in-the-shiny-contest/22445" class="uri">https://community.rstudio.com/t/take-part-in-the-shiny-contest/22445</a> and shamelessly took the opportunity to submit a couple of the shiny apps that I built last year after being inspired by Michigan’s own <a href="https://twitter.com/AskJustinBaker">Justin Baker</a> when he presented a Flex Dashboard at Socrata Connect, <a href="https://socrata.com/video/using-open-analytics-to-improve-government-performance/">Using Open Analytics to Improve Government Performance</a>.</p>
<div id="discovery-api" class="section level2">
<h2>Discovery API</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://socratadiscovery.docs.apiary.io">Discovery API</a> returns all data found on Socrata client domains. Without any authentication, only public assets will be returned. Credentialed users may query their private assets as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="open-data-explorer" class="section level2">
<h2>Open Data Explorer</h2>
<p>This shiny app, <a href="https://alicia.shinyapps.io/OpenDataDiscovereR/" class="uri">https://alicia.shinyapps.io/OpenDataDiscovereR/</a> randomly queries a topic to the discovery api and returns top results by page views from the last week, month and ever.</p>
</div>
<div id="state-data-explorer" class="section level2">
<h2>State Data Explorer</h2>
<p>This shiny app, <a href="https://alicia.shinyapps.io/StateDataExploreR/" class="uri">https://alicia.shinyapps.io/StateDataExploreR/</a> returns top assets and metadata visualizations for some of the top state data portals hosted on Socrata.</p>
