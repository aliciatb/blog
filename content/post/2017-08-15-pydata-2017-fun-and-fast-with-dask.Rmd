[PyData 2017](https://pydata.org/seattle2017/), held on the Microsoft campus in the summer of 2017 included a tutorial on improving performance with the library dask.

## Dask [Notebook](https://github.com/aliciatb/blog/blob/master/notebooks/dask_demo.ipynb)!

Due to the size of the html generated for this notebook and it crashing on render, it's best viewed directly via [dask_demo.html](dask_demo.html) until I see if I can reduce file from 1.9 MB. 

```{r, eval = F}
library(htmltools)
# jupyter nbconvert --to html ~/repos/blog/notebooks/dask_demo.ipynb
# includeHTML("../../notebooks/dask_demo.html")
```
