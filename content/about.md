title: About Me
---

It was brought to my attention at the last [RStudio conference](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019) by [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/@drob)'s talk, _[The unreasonable effectiveness of public work](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work)_ that I have an obligation to share my learnings to the entire world. Thus, this blog.

## My Story

- Last 4 years have partnered with government and public sector agencies developing Open Data programs and creating a culture of internal data sharing to inform decisions and deliver equitable outcomes
- My journey to data has included a path as a web developer, technical project manager, data analyst and currently technical solution architect
- Learning is everything to me!
- Agile practicioner

## My Prevailing Interests

- Data, all kinds! (Demographic, expenditures, equity, police, weed, sea lions, meta, etc.)
- People - energized and inspired by the teams I have the privilege to partner with on projects
- Love R, Python, Power BI, Tableau and Excel (quite certain that my next gig will likely be in a Data Evangelist role using delightful tools to accelerate data insights)
- I am an impatient advocate for diversity and dream of the day when people include all people and not merely _guys_
- I insist on leadership accountability (as well as my own) and envision a day when we tackle issues _now_ rather than later
