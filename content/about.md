It was brought to my attention at the last [RStudio conference](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019) by [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/@drob)'s talk, _[The unreasonable effectiveness of public work](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work)_ that I have an obligation to share my learnings to the entire world. Thus, this blog.

## My Prevailing Interests

- Data, all kinds! (Demographic, economic, equity, financial, police, environmental, weed, sea lions, meta, and performance benchmarks.)
- People - energized and inspired by the teams I have the privilege to partner with on projects.
- Love R, Python, Power BI, Tableau, Excel and mixing data with markdown for communication to others and reminders to future me
- I am an impatient advocate for diversity and inclusivity on teams
