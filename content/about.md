## Appreciations

It was brought to my attention at the last [RStudio conference](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019) by [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/@drob)'s talk, _[The unreasonable effectiveness of public work](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work)_ that I have an obligation to share my learnings to the entire world. Thus, this blog.
